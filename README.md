## Icons and functions

1.Make a map of the world with all the tracks marked on<br>
    This section generates a world map with all the tracks labelled, making it easy for the reader to retrieve what tracks are available in which locations in different countries.
   
2.Create a chart comparing the current drivers' place per race<br>
    This section creates a scatter plot to compare the rankings of all active drivers in each race, and by moving the mouse you can clearly see which driver is in first place in which race.
  
3.Pie chart of rider share by country<br>
    This section shows the percentage of nationalities of all drivers ever, so you can clearly see the percentages and how many F1 drivers are in each country.
  
4.Table of Driver's Historical Score Totals<br>
    In this section I have created a bar chart of the drivers' historical totals and arranged them in descending order. You can clearly see their names, total scores by moving your mouse.
    
5.Fastest driver per race stop<br>
    This section shows the fastest pit stops in seconds for each race and the corresponding drivers. You can also change the "color" in the code to retrieve which races your favourite driver is the fastest pit stop holder.
